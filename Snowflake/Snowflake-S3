Create an External Stage for S3

First, create a named external stage pointing to your S3 bucket:

CREATE STAGE my_s3_stage
  URL = 's3://my-bucket-name/path/'
  STORAGE_INTEGRATION = my_s3_integration
  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='"');

-------- OR---------
CREATE STAGE my_s3_stage
  URL='s3://my-bucket/data/'
  CREDENTIALS = (AWS_KEY_ID='...' AWS_SECRET_KEY='...')
  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV');

Unload (Push) Data to S3 from a Table

COPY INTO @my_s3_stage
FROM my_table
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='"');

LIST @my_s3_stage;
